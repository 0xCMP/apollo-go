# apollo-go
An [http handler](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler) to use [graphql-go](https://github.com/neelance/graphql-go) with [apollo client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client).

### Notes
- This handler only supports [batched queries](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/query-batching-in-apollo-63acfd859862#.p7459gedh). It doesn't support all of the apollo stack featuers.
